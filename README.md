# Chrome-Extension-Hello-
This is a chrome extension that I have been working on for the past day. It is a "Hello world" chrome extension with a button, and a little text. To run it, you can just download all the code, put it into a folder, go into developer mode in your chrome extensions, load unpacked, select the folder, and run it!
